					<p><span>My Name-</span> The Company is Solografix (One graphics).  It implies that you only need one company 
					to take care of all your website, advertising, and graphic design needs...and me? My name is Colby.</p>
					
					<p><span class="prompt">Who am I?</span> I am currently a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  I recently decided
					to go back to school to further improve myself and to learn more about the always changing and ever improving computer 
					technology that surrounds us everywhere today.  I am currently working towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Technology
					with a minor in Web Design and Development. I will help you in any way I can.</p>
					
					<p><span>What are my goals?</span> I plan to incorporate much of what I am learning into the current company I work for 
					by expanding the online presence of the business.  I will also incorporate my learning by becoming the in house information technology 
					specialist in our company.  I would also like to learn more computer programming.  I would like to learn 
					enough to be able to create apps for Android, Apple, and Windows based devices.</p>
